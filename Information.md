## Description of the Two Features:

### File Upload:
The file upload feature allows users to select and upload multiple files to the Multimedia Web App. When the user selects files through the file input field, the `handleFileUpload` function is triggered. It generates unique IDs for each file and creates an object containing the file's name, path, and type. The uploaded files are then added to the existing `myFiles` state, enabling them to be displayed and interacted with in the file list.

### Search Functionality:
The search feature enables users to search for files based on their names. As the user types into the search input field, the `onChange` event triggers the `setSearchText` function, updating the `searchText` state with the entered value. The `useEffect` hook listens to changes in the `searchText` state and filters the files in the `myFiles` state accordingly. The filtered files are stored in the `filteredFiles` state, and they are displayed in the file list, allowing users to find specific files quickly.

## Reasons for Choosing These Features:
The file upload feature was chosen to enhance the functionality of the Multimedia Web App by allowing users to add their own files, expanding the range of content available for playback and viewing. It provides users with a convenient way to upload their multimedia files, such as videos, audios, images, and documents.

The search functionality was implemented to improve the user experience and efficiency of finding files within the app. As the number of files grows, searching becomes crucial for quickly locating specific files. By incorporating search, users can easily filter and access files based on their names, saving time and effort.

## Explanation of How the Code Works:
The code initializes the necessary states, including `myFiles` (for storing the uploaded files), `selectedFile` (for tracking the currently selected file), `filePath` (for defining the file path), `showChartModal` (for controlling the visibility of the chart modal), `searchText` (for storing the search input), and `filteredFiles` (for storing the filtered files based on the search criteria).

The `useEffect` hook is used to populate the `myFiles` state with initial data when the component mounts. It also listens for changes in the `myFiles` and `searchText` states to update the `filteredFiles` state accordingly.

The `handleFileUpload` function is triggered when the user selects files for upload. It processes the selected files, generates unique IDs for each file, determines their types, and adds them to the `myFiles` state.

The `searchFiles` function is called when the user clicks the search button. It filters the `myFiles` state based on the `searchText` and updates the `filteredFiles` state.

The code also includes the necessary UI elements, event handlers, and conditional rendering logic to display the file list, handle file selection, perform actions like downloading and deleting files, and render the file viewer component when a file is selected.

Overall, the modified code integrates the file upload and search features seamlessly into the Multimedia Web App, enhancing its functionality and user experience.
